Driven by passion, curiosity, and perseverance with big dreams to rise high in the world of Computer Science and Engineering, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering with honors. I have had 2 years experience as a _Site Reliability Engineer_ at *DE Shaw & Co*, and 2 months of experience as _Systems & Operations Engineering Intern_ before my full-time stint. I also had the opportunity to develop software for *Swayam Satellite Mission*: the first successful student-driven satellite mission in India.

I relish collaborating with like-minded people and I always want to be a part of the change for good. Iâ€™m in the constant process of refining my development process, seek for more efficiency, and researching new tools and technologies.
